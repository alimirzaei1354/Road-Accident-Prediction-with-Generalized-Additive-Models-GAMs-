# Generalized additive models for Prediction non-linear trends in Road-Accidents data using R:Different than what has been done so far.
## This repository contains all the code a used in my activity ,  In this paper we explore the use of generalized additive models (GAMs) in road  accidents research.
### This work was created using R. Therefore, you need to install the latest version of R. Additionally, it is recommended that and IDE such as RStudio is installed as well. Directions to install R and RStudio can be found here.
The most important library used in this research is "mgcv", which you can find in the mgcv.pdf.
